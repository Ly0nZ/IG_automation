# Project Title

Javascript automation for Instagram 'likes'

## Getting Started

Created an automation tool that will automatically 'like' posts. This code can be executed within your browser's console. 

### Prerequisites

A browser that offers client access to the console, such as Chrome.
Download Chrome here: https://www.google.com/chrome/


### Installing

Once your browser is installed, navigate your browser to Instagram.com and log in to your account.
From here use the search bar for a popular #Hashtag you would like to target.
With the posts page related to the given hashtag pulled up, select the first post to start with.
After clicking open the first post, copy/paste the code into the browser console and hit enter.

The console should automatically begin 'liking' and moving to the next post based on the frequency parameters set within the code. This parameter is documented in the program and can be adjusted.
